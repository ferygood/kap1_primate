# Use SQuIRE to map TE in locus level

## Download SQuIRE

[SQuIRE](https://github.com/wyang17/SQuIRE) is published in Nucleic Acid Research in 2019 (doi.org/10.1093/nar/gky1301) and I try to follow the download steps from its github. However, it is hard to install because it is maintain in Python 2.7 and R 3.4 and not updating anymore.

Therefore, here is the way I install SQuIRE on my laptop:

1.  Download the latest Miniconda3 (v24.7.1)

2.  Download Miniforge (<https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge>) instead of mamba, and select the macOS x86_64 version.

3.  After download miniforge, you can use mamba to install SQuIRE:

``` bash
mamba create -n squire -c bioconda squire
```

## Run SQuIRE

### 1. Preparation stage

#### Fetch

Download input files from RefGene and generates STAR index.

``` bash
# for hg19
squire Fetch -b hg19 -o human -f -c -r -g -x -p 3 -v

# for panTro4
squire Fetch -b panTro4 -o chimp -f -c -r -g -x -p 3 -v

# for ponAbe2
squire Fetch -b ponAbe2 -o chimp -f -c -r -g -x -p 3 -v
```

#### Clean

Filters genomic coordinates of repeats of interest from repeatmasker, collapses overlapping TEs, and returns BED file and count of subfamily copies. Only needs to be done at the first use of SQuIRE pipeline to clean up the index files. Outputs .bed file of TE coordinates, strand and divergence

``` bash
# example of hg19
squire Clean -r human -b hg19 -o hg19_clean -c 'DNA,LTR' -v
```
