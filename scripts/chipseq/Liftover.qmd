# Liftover comparison across species

```{r}
library(dplyr)
```

How many of the peaks are overlapped?

```{r}
hm_chimp <- read.table("../../peaks/liftover/human_chimp_overlap.bed", sep='\t')
hm_chimp_distinct <- hm_chimp %>% distinct() #19

hm_oran <- read.table("../../peaks/liftover/human_oran_overlap.bed", sep='\t')
hm_oran_distinct <- hm_oran %>% distinct() #820

chimp_oran <- read.table("../../peaks/liftover/chimp_oran_overlap.bed", sep='\t')
chimp_oran_distinct <- chimp_oran %>% distinct() #178
```

```{r}
hm_chimp_oran <- hm_chimp_distinct %>%
    select(c(1,2,3,4)) %>%
    inner_join(hm_oran_distinct[,c(1,2,3,4)], join_by(V4==V4)) #only 2
```

Let's see what kind of TEs are them:
```{r}
human_ref <- read.table("../../peaks/macs3_results/hm_TE.peak", sep='\t')
hm_chimp_distinct_list <- hm_chimp_distinct$V4


```
